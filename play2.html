        <speech>Ah, Sir, I beg of you....
        </speech></p>
            <TRI>TRI</TRI>  <p>
            <speech>If I offend you, my offence is not likely to cease. This love,
                ignored by you to this day, will be of eternal duration. Nothing can
                put a stop to its delightful transports; and although your beauty
                condemns my endeavours, I cannot refuse the help of a mother who
                wishes to crown such a precious flame. Provided I succeed in obtaining
                such great happiness, provided I obtain your hand, it matters little
                to me how it comes to pass.</speech></p>
            
            <HEN>HEN</HEN>  <p>
            <speech> But are you aware, Sir, that you risk more than you think by
                using violence; and to be plain with you, that it is not safe to marry
                a girl against her wish, for she might well have recourse to a certain
                revenge that a husband should fear.
            </speech></p>
