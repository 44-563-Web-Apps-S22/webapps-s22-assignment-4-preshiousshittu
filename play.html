        <h2>The Learned Woman </h2>
        <h3>Act V. SCENE I.--HENRIETTE, TRISSOTIN.</h3>
        <HEN>HEN</HEN> <p>
        <speech>I thank you for your generous love; I ought to feel grateful and
            to respond to it; I regret that I cannot; I esteem you as much as one
            can esteem another; but in me I find an obstacle to loving you. You
            know that a heart cannot be given to two people, and I feel that
            Clitandre has taken entire possession of mine. I know that he has much
            less merit than you, that I have not fit discrimination for the choice
            of a husband, and that with your many talents you ought to please me.
            I see that I am wrong, but I cannot help it; and all the power that
            reason has over me is to make me angry with myself for such blindness.
        </speech></p>
            <TRI>TRI</TRI>  <p>
            <speech>The gift of your hand, to which I am allowed to aspire, will give
            me the heart possessed by Clitandre; for by a thousand tender cares I
            have reason to hope that I shall succeed in making myself loved.</speech></p>
            
            <HEN>HEN</HEN>  <p>
            <speech> No; my heart is bound to its first love, and cannot be touched by
            your cares and attention. I explain myself plainly with you, and my
            confession ought in no way to hurt your feelings. The love which
            springs up in the heart is not, as you know, the effect of merit, but
            is partly decided by caprice; and oftentimes, when some one pleases
            us, we can barely find the reason. If choice and wisdom guided love,
            all the tenderness of my heart would be for you; but love is not thus
            guided. Leave me, I pray, to my blindness; and do not profit by the
            violence which, for your sake, is imposed on my obedience. A man of
            honour will owe nothing to the power which parents have over us; he
            feels a repugnance to exact a self-sacrifice from her he loves, and
            will not obtain a heart by force. Do not encourage my mother to
            exercise, for your sake, the absolute power she has over me. Give up
            your love for me, and carry to another the homage of a heart so
            precious as yours.
            </speech></p>
            
        <TRI>TRI</TRI>  <p>
        <speech>  For this heart to satisfy you, you must impose upon it laws it
            can obey. Could it cease to love you, Madam, unless you ceased to be
            loveable, and could cease to display those celestial charms....
        </speech></p>

            <HEN>HEN</HEN> <p>
            <speech> Ah! Sir, leave aside all this trash; you are encumbered with so
            many Irises, Phyllises, Amaranthas, which everywhere in your verses
            you paint as charming, and to whom you swear such love, that....
            </speech></p>

        <TRI>TRI</TRI>  <p>
         <speech> It is the mind that speaks, and not the heart. With them it is
            only the poet that is in love; but it is in earnest that I love the
            adorable Henriette.
        </speech></p>
            
            <HEN>HEN</HEN> <p>
             <speech>Ah, Sir, I beg of you....
             </speech></p>
